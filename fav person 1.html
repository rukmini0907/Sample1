<b>mavya</b> is one of my best friend who cares about me and supports me in every situation.<br>
  <i>she always use to guides me in my crucial times.</i><br>
  <u>we had known each other from last 4 years and we had been best friends since last two years.<br>
    <sub>Both of us interests are almost similar like, we both love dancing, arts and doing creative things.</sub><br>
    <sup>as we are being interested in same things we even have similar music taste.</sup></br>
    <b><i><u>we loves to watch movies, hanging out with each other and sharing all the things which was happened to us.</b></i></u><br>
    <mark>As everybody knows that she is an introvert and I'm an extrovert so we use to be an perfect besties.</mark><br>
      <em> Since there is a lot of things to say about her due to excess of work I'm ending my words here.</em></br>
    <i><h3>THANK YOU</h3></i><br>
